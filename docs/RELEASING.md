Create a Modrinth **Mod** project for Mushroom the Yorkie with these values:

- Name: `Mushroom the Yorkie`
- Suggested slug: `mushroom-the-yorkie`

- Client environment: `Required`

## Configure publishing

After the Modrinth project exists:

1. Create a Modrinth personal access token with version publishing permission.
2. In GitHub, open **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.
3. Add a repository secret named `MODRINTH_TOKEN`.
4. Add a repository variable named `MODRINTH_PROJECT_ID` containing the NARwhal project ID or slug.
5. Add a repository variable named `MUSHROOM_MODRINTH_PROJECT_ID` containing the Mushroom project ID or slug. If this is omitted, the workflows use the slug `mushroom-the-yorkie`.

Never commit the token.

Run **Sync Modrinth Metadata** from the repository's Actions tab whenever the name, description, license, links, icon, or gallery material changes. Select the mod to sync from the workflow input. The workflow leaves the project's review status unchanged.

## Publish

1. Complete `docs/TESTING.md` using the exact JAR being released.
2. Update `mod_version` in `gradle.properties`.
3. Commit and push the release changes.
4. Open the repository's **Actions** tab.
5. Run **Publish to Modrinth**, select the mod, and select `alpha`, `beta`, or `release`.

The workflow rebuilds from the selected commit and uploads the remapped production JAR. The publishing task declares Fabric API as required. NARwhal also declares Controlify as optional.
