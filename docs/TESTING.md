# Testing

Use automated CLI checks first, then do a short manual pass for visuals, feel, and multiplayer behavior that cannot be proven cheaply from tests.

## Automated CLI Checks

Run all verification:

```shell
./gradlew check
```

This runs:

- root `validateModLayout`
- root `validateFormatting`
- root `validateJavaFileSizes`
- root `validateNoClientImportsInMain`
- root `validatePublicApiDocs`
- per-mod Javadoc generation
- JVM unit tests for every mod subproject
- normal Gradle/Fabric check tasks

Run one mod's tests:

```shell
./gradlew :narwhal-together:test
./gradlew :mushroom-the-yorkie:test
```

Run a supported NARwhal Minecraft-version variant:

```shell
./gradlew :narwhal-together:check -Ptarget_minecraft_version=1.21.1
```

Build all jars:

```shell
./gradlew build
```

Production jars are written to:

```text
build/mods/narwhal-together/<minecraft-version>/libs/narwhal-together-<version>.jar
build/mods/mushroom-the-yorkie/<minecraft-version>/libs/mushroom-the-yorkie-<version>.jar
```

Run Mushroom's headless Minecraft GameTests:

```shell
./gradlew :mushroom-the-yorkie:runGameTestServer
```

GameTests boot a scripted Minecraft server from the CLI. They are slower than unit tests, so keep them focused on behavior that needs a real world, entity registry, or server tick loop.

## Current Automated Coverage

NARwhal Together:

- target cycling selects the first target when no previous target exists
- target cycling advances to the next target
- target cycling wraps back to the first target
- target cycling recovers when the previous target left the game
- empty target lists are rejected

Mushroom the Yorkie:

- default pet needs
- save/load value clamping
- treat effects
- indoor need ticking
- hungry potty acceleration
- sitting energy behavior
- outside potty drain and mood boost
- indoor potty warning mood penalty
- wake-up spawn policy for respawn and extreme modes
- spawn-mode config parsing defaults
- headless GameTest verifies Mushroom's custom entity can spawn in a Minecraft test world

Root layout validation:

- root `src/` does not exist
- every mod has `src/main/java`
- every mod has `src/client/java`
- every mod has `src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json`
- Gradle `mod_id` matches `fabric.mod.json`
- mod IDs are unique
- declared icons exist
- declared entrypoint classes exist
- duplicate translation keys are rejected
- non-Minecraft item model textures must exist

Quality gates:

- source text cannot have CRLF line endings, trailing whitespace, or missing final newlines
- Java files warn over 300 lines and fail over 500 lines
- common/server source cannot import client-only classes
- public declarations need Javadocs unless they override Minecraft/Fabric APIs
- Javadocs must generate successfully

Good future GameTests:

- Mushroom spawn egg creates the custom entity
- Yorkie treat tames Mushroom
- owner can toggle sit/follow
- non-owner cannot command Mushroom
- NARwhal payload registration does not fail on startup

## Manual Acceptance Checks

NARwhal Together:

- [ ] Minecraft 1.21.11 launches with Fabric API and NARwhal Together.
- [ ] The server or LAN host has the same NARwhal Together JAR as every client.
- [ ] With two players online, each player can teleport to the other.
- [ ] Teleporting works without operator permissions.
- [ ] Teleporting between the Overworld, Nether, and End works.
- [ ] Repeated uses cycle through three or more players alphabetically.
- [ ] Spectators are skipped.
- [ ] No errors attributed to `narwhal_together` appear in the latest log.

Mushroom the Yorkie:

- [ ] Minecraft 1.21.11 launches with Fabric API and Mushroom the Yorkie.
- [ ] The Mushroom spawn egg creates a small Yorkie entity.
- [ ] Mushroom renders with pointy ears and no missing texture.
- [ ] Yorkie treats tame and feed Mushroom.
- [ ] Mutton + two bones crafts 8 Yorkie Treats.
- [ ] Creative inventory has a Mushroom the Yorkie tab.
- [ ] After a successful night in a bed, Mushroom appears near the bed already tamed.
- [ ] Empty-hand owner interaction toggles sit/follow.
- [ ] Mushroom follows closely enough to feel like a tiny companion.
- [ ] No errors attributed to `mushroom_yorkie` appear in the latest log.
